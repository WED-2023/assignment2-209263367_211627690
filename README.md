Welcome to the "Galactic Invaders" project! 🚀

## 🛠️ Project Overview

The website was built using:
- **HTML5** (Single page - `index.html`)
- **CSS3** (Responsive design, optimized for a minimum screen resolution of 1366x768)
- **JavaScript (Modular)** (`auth.js`, `config.js`, `game.js`, `utils.js`)

The site includes:
- A Welcome screen with a video trailer
- Registration and Login pages
- Configuration screen (select shooting key, game duration, spaceship)
- Full playable Space Invaders-style game:
  - Player spaceship movement
  - Enemy ships shooting randomly
  - Scoring system based on enemy row
  - Enemy acceleration every 5 seconds
  - Countdown timer
  - Personal score history for each player
  - Guest login available (`username: p`, `password: testuser`)
- An "About" screen (Modal dialog)

Additional features beyond basic requirements:
- Boss ships appear after defeating all enemies, requiring multiple hits to destroy.
- Background video during gameplay (`wallpaper.mp4`)
- Background music playing during the game
- Automatic stopping of music when switching screens
- Player’s high-score table and historical tracking
